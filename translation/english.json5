// If you want to translate CSharpPluginPack into another language, follow these steps (in the example below, we are translating into the "fooish" language):
// 1. Create a copy of this file at the path "translation/fooish.json5" relative to the CSharpPluginPack plugin directory (the directory where the CSharpPluginPack.dll binary is installed, *not* the plugin config directory).
// 2. Edit the values associated with the various keys in this document.
//     DO NOT CHANGE THE KEYS OF ANY OBJECT, OR ADD OR REMOVE KEYS! ONLY CHANGE THE VALUES.
// 3. Close Notepad++ and reopen it, then look at the various CSharpPluginPack forms and menu items to see if the translation is satisfactory.
